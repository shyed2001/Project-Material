
Lists

Lists are another type of object in Python. They are used to store an indexed list of items. 
A list is created using square brackets with commas separating items.
The certain item in the list can be accessed by using its index in square brackets.
For example:
words = ["Hello", "world", "!"]
print(words[0])
print(words[1])
print(words[2])

Result:
>>>
Hello
world
!
>>>

The first list item's index is 0, rather than 1, as might be expected.



Lists

An empty list is created with an empty pair of square brackets.
empty_list = []
print(empty_list)

Result:
>>>
[]
>>>

Most of the time, a comma won't follow the last item in a list. However,
 it is perfectly valid to place one there, and it is encouraged in some cases.
