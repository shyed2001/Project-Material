how does remainder or  modulus operator works


a % b = a - b * floor(a/b)


An expression like x % y evaluates to the remainder of x ÷ y.
Precedence is the same as operators / (division) and * (multiplication).

>>> 9 / 2
4
>>> 9 % 2
1




% Modulo operator can be also used for printing strings (Just like in C)
 as defined on Google https://developers.google.com/edu/python/strings.

      # % operator
  text = "%d little pigs come out
 or I'll %s and %s and %s" % (3, 'huff', 'puff', 'blow down')

This seems to bit off topic but It will certainly help someone.


Somewhat off topic, the % is also used in string formatting operations 
like %= to substitute values into a string:

>>> x = 'abc_%(key)s_'
>>> x %= {'key':'value'}
>>> x 
'abc_value_'
Again, off topic, but it seems to be a little documented feature which took 
me awhile to track down, and I thought it was related to Pythons modulo calculation for which this SO page ranks highly.




Also, there is a useful built-in function called divmod:

divmod(a, b)

Take two (non complex) numbers as arguments and return a pair of numbers 

consisting of their quotient and remainder when using long division.
